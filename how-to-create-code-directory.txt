How to Create code/source directory:

1. Clean solution in Visual Studio (in both configurations, Debug and Release, x64).

2. Copy the directories in cgj-proj4 to code/source folder (bin, project, and resources).

3. Remove .vs directory from project, remove the backup of the assets directory (if still exists),
and the content of the intermediate directory.

4. Remove the unnecessary content from the resources directory if needed (see what was
removed in the release branch for details).

1. Copy cgj.exe, the .dlls, and the assets folder to code/release.
